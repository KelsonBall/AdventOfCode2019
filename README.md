# 2019 Advent of Code Solutions

This is an educational repository where I am implementing solutions to each puzzle in the [2019 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) in my favorite languages: C#, Kotlin, Python, Rust, and Lua. Becuase of the wide variety of topics and difficulties in the puzzle prompts I hope this will be a useful asset for coders familiar with any of these languages to learn any of the others by comparing solutions. 

# Contributions Welcome

Your contributions are very welcome! 
 * Improvements to the Prompt Descriptions
 * Alternative solutions
 * Adjust solutions to be more idiomatic to their languages standard styles
 * Adding educational additional education material
 * Adding unit tests
 
# Prompt Descriptions

In the [prompts](./prompts/) directory I hope to provide alternatives to the official puzzle prompts without the word-problem writing style, with references to coding and programing concepts the puzzles relate to, and with resources that students can use to learn more about those related topics.
