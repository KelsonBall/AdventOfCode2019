# Prompt Summaries

This directory contains alternative and suplementery explanations of the puzzles designed to allow you to focus more directly on the puzzle itself rather than on trying to interpret the word problem and comb through for important pieces of information you missed.

They also contain links and vocabulary to help students learn more about the topics that show up in the puzzles.

These summaries are intented to be more detailed than the puzzle prompts and may be considered spoilers.
